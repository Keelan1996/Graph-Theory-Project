# Graph Theory Assessment

Hello my name is Keelan Duddy. This github page will show the learning outcomes I have earned in the module Graph Theory in 3rd year software development at GMIT.

For this module we were asked to:
Explain in depth how Heap sort algorithm works and provide implementation.
Discuss and conceptualise the Graph Isomorphism Problem.

We will be doing this through the programming language called Python. Python is one the top programming languages right now. It's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. A lot of data scientists learn python due to it's powerful capabilities in data science with its many great libraries that deal with data science application. 

The second reason why is the easy to learn syntax compared to other languages, this is important because many data scientist might not have the a lot of knowledge when it comes to programming and don't want to get bogged down with the nitty gritty some programming languages can have.

So Python will be a great way to demonstrate heap-sort algorithm and Graph Isomorphism Problem. How will we be doing this is through notebooks from a Python package known as Jupyter. Jupyter notebooks is a really helpful tool to visualise data in a detailed and organised manner.

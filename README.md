# Graph Theory Assessment

## Introduction
Hello my name is Keelan Duddy. This github page contains my end of the year assessment for Graph Theory, Summer 2021/2022. The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate my understanding, and learning outcomes I have earned in the module Graph Theory in 3rd year software development at GMIT. 

## Module

#### Graph Theory

Graph theory is the study of graphs which is a mathematical structure use to model pair wise relationships between objects from a collection. Graph theory uses vertices (nodes/points) and edges (lines) to show these relationships. We will be using graph theory to help us demonstrate the contents of this notebook which involves Heap sort and Graph Isomorphism.

## Contents 

For this module we were asked to:

- Explain in depth how Heap sort algorithm works and provide implementation.

- Discuss and conceptualise the Graph Isomorphism Problem.


We will be doing this through the programming language called Python. Python is one the top programming languages right now. It's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. A lot of data scientists learn python due to it's powerful capabilities in data science with its many great libraries that deal with data science application. 

The second reason why is the easy to learn syntax compared to other languages, this is important because many data scientist might not have the a lot of knowledge when it comes to programming and don't want to get bogged down with the nitty gritty some programming languages can have.

So Python will be a great way to demonstrate heap-sort algorithm and Graph Isomorphism Problem. How will we be doing this is through notebooks from a Python package known as Jupyter. Jupyter notebooks is a really helpful tool to visualise data in a detailed and organised manner.

## Installation

If you wish to look at the contents of the notebook closer, you will need to install jupyter notebook. 

#### Jupyter Notebook

Juyter installation requires Python 3.3 or greater.

[Click here to install Jupyter via Python Installation](https://test-jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/rtd-theme/install.html#:~:text=Prerequisite%3A%20Jupyter%20installation%20requires%20Python,package%20manager%2C%20or%20using%20Anaconda.)

Once you followed the guides instructions, clone this repository and open up your terminal at the designated location and type in and run this command:

###### jupyter notebook

After this the jupter notebook will pop up in your browser of choice.

Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web appliction that allows you to create and share documents that contain code, visualisations, equations and detailed notes. Many data scientist use jupyter notebook for statistc modelling, machine learning, data visualisations and much more.

## Issues
If you have any issues or questions please contact me at my email: Keelanduddy@gmail.com
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
